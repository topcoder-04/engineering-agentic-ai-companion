# Chapter 35 companion — Owning the Agent After Launch

This checkpoint adds owned, expiring exceptions that cannot waive hard boundaries.

## What this chapter adds

- Durable operating ownership and controlled exceptions live in `platform/lifecycle/`.
- The conformant Orders candidate must name its operator, runbook, and rollback owner before execution.
- A composition test proves an ownerless candidate cannot run despite valid artifact evidence.

The map lists the actual cumulative implementation surface at this checkpoint. A responsibility appears only when this chapter or an earlier chapter has earned it; `ARCHITECTURE.md` and the structural tests enforce that timing.
## Run this checkpoint

Prerequisites are Python 3.11 or newer and Git. Docker is optional and used only by the Chapter 14 host-isolation probe; OPA is optional for the Chapter 20 Rego mapping.

Use the portable reader path from a fresh checkout:

```bash
git switch chapter-35
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e '.[test]'
python -m pytest tests/test_chapter_35.py
python -m pytest
python scripts/run_current_chapter.py
```

On Windows PowerShell, activate with `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`. The manuscript-compatible command executes the same chapter file:

```bash
python -m orders_investigation.demo chapter-35
```

Expected outcome: The owned candidate runs, while a non-waivable residency exception remains refused.

The demo opens with the building block introduced in this chapter, then shows
the real scenario, boundary decision, execution result, and what to notice.
Interactive terminals use the book's five movement colors automatically. Use
`--plain` or the `NO_COLOR` environment variable for plain text, or `--color`
to force color when output is being captured:

```bash
python scripts/run_current_chapter.py --plain
python scripts/run_current_chapter.py --color
```

Color reinforces the labels but never carries meaning alone: `APPROVED`,
`REFUSED`, and `NOT EXECUTED` remain explicit in plain output.

`uv` is optional. If it is installed, the equivalent path is:

```bash
uv sync --extra test
uv run --no-sync pytest tests/test_chapter_35.py
uv run --no-sync pytest
uv run --no-sync python scripts/run_current_chapter.py
```

The `test` extra is the portable reader contract. CI installs the all-extras superset, so optional LangGraph and HTTPX integration coverage may add checks without changing the chapter's offline acceptance result.

## Behavioral spine

Lifecycle ownership follows artifact conformance and remains a launch veto. The
owned Orders candidate continues through the paved path and completes. Removing its
operator does not invalidate the receipt, but it still prevents execution: proof of
what passed cannot replace proof of who owns the running system.
## Deliberately incomplete

This branch contains no platform capability introduced after Chapter 35. Chapter 36 addresses the next manuscript pressure.

## Architecture evolution at this checkpoint

The tracked responsibility map now contains only the packages earned through Chapter 35. Later packages are absent from this branch.

`ARCHITECTURE.md` records only Chapters 1-35 as present evolution; `main` carries the complete roadmap.
