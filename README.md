# Chapter 11 companion — Keeping a Long Investigation on Course

Chapter 10 can add relevant lessons, but a growing task graph still remembers possibilities rather than purpose. This chapter makes the active causal question explicit and enforceable.

## What this chapter adds

- A persistent task spine with purpose, current milestone, question, and allowed tasks.
- Evidence-backed milestone transitions.
- Refusal of graph-ready work outside the active milestone.
- A report-support policy that includes only evidence on accepted causal milestones.
- Decision-surface comparison across current state, memory, and active direction.

The map lists the actual cumulative implementation surface at this checkpoint. A responsibility appears only when this chapter or an earlier chapter has earned it; `ARCHITECTURE.md` and the structural tests enforce that timing.
## Run this checkpoint

```bash
uv sync --extra test
uv run --no-sync pytest
uv run --no-sync python scripts/run_current_chapter.py
```

The full test command includes behavioral, evidence-provenance, README, and folder-evolution gates. The current demo is deterministic and offline; CI runs the same commands.
## Evidence

Three preserved live-call records expose the exact progression: current state, current state plus reviewed memory, and current state plus the active spine. Provider output is never treated as admission proof.

## Deliberately incomplete

The spine keeps one investigation directed. Chapter 12 lets multiple workers share ready work safely through expiring ownership and fencing tokens.

## Architecture evolution

The active causal question becomes a durable graph spine. No later responsibility appears early.

The real execution path follows the responsibility packages introduced through this chapter. Current packages: `domain/`, `environment/`, `runtime/`, `decisions/`, `graph/`, `context/`, `effects/`, `memory/`. See `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
