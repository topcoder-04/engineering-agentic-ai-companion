# Chapter 24 companion — Making Evaluation a Release Boundary

This checkpoint adds a fail-closed release gate combining quality, safety, latency, and unit budgets.

## What this chapter adds

- A fail-closed release gate combining quality, safety, latency, and unit budgets.
- Release evidence is now derived from executed Orders journeys and their Chapter 23 evaluations.
- A composition test proves one refused effect stops the candidate release.

The map lists the actual cumulative implementation surface at this checkpoint. A responsibility appears only when this chapter or an earlier chapter has earned it; `ARCHITECTURE.md` and the structural tests enforce that timing.
## Run this checkpoint

```bash
uv sync --extra test
uv run --no-sync pytest
uv run --no-sync python scripts/run_current_chapter.py
```

The full test command includes behavioral, evidence-provenance, README, and folder-evolution gates. The current demo is deterministic and offline; CI runs the same commands.

## Behavioral spine

The release gate consumes evaluation results and traces created by the shared Orders
journey. A campaign containing only the completed path advances. Adding the
stale-evidence refusal lowers the pass rate and spends the safety-failure budget, so
the same candidate is denied rather than receiving hand-built release evidence.
## Deliberately incomplete

No platform capability from Chapters 29–37 exists yet. Chapter 25 introduces the next manuscript pressure.

## Architecture evolution

Release gates complete the evaluation boundary. No later responsibility appears early.
