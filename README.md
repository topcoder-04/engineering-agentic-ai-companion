# Chapter 26 companion — Testing What Authored Cases Missed

This checkpoint adds stable variation matrices across models, dependency faults, and timing offsets.

## What this chapter adds

- Stable variation planning lives in `operations/probes.py`; evaluation remains in its own boundary.
- Every planned model, fault, and timing row now executes the shared Orders journey.
- A composition test proves the stale-evidence variations are refused and fail evaluation.

The map lists the actual cumulative implementation surface at this checkpoint. A responsibility appears only when this chapter or an earlier chapter has earned it; `ARCHITECTURE.md` and the structural tests enforce that timing.
## Run this checkpoint

Prerequisites are Python 3.11 or newer and Git. Docker is optional and used only by the Chapter 14 host-isolation probe; OPA is optional for the Chapter 20 Rego mapping.

Use the portable reader path from a fresh checkout:

```bash
git switch chapter-26
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e '.[test]'
python -m pytest tests/test_chapter_26.py
python -m pytest
python scripts/run_current_chapter.py
```

On Windows PowerShell, activate with `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`. The manuscript-compatible command executes the same chapter file:

```bash
python -m orders_investigation.demo chapter-26
```

Expected outcome: The two-by-two-by-two matrix executes eight stable variations and exposes the first refusal.

The demo opens with the building block introduced in this chapter, then shows
the real scenario, boundary decision, execution result, and what to notice.
Interactive terminals use the book's five movement colors automatically. Use
`--plain` or the `NO_COLOR` environment variable for plain text, or `--color`
to force color when output is being captured:

```bash
python scripts/run_current_chapter.py --plain
python scripts/run_current_chapter.py --color
```

Color reinforces the labels but never carries meaning alone: `APPROVED`,
`REFUSED`, and `NOT EXECUTED` remain explicit in plain output.

`uv` is optional. If it is installed, the equivalent path is:

```bash
uv sync --extra test
uv run --no-sync pytest tests/test_chapter_26.py
uv run --no-sync pytest
uv run --no-sync python scripts/run_current_chapter.py
```

The `test` extra is the portable reader contract. CI installs the all-extras superset, so optional LangGraph and HTTPX integration coverage may add checks without changing the chapter's offline acceptance result.

## Behavioral spine

The variation matrix is no longer only a catalog of identifiers. All eight rows run
the same Orders investigation and evaluation contract. Model size and timing leave
the deterministic path stable; the injected stale-evidence dependency state reaches
the effect boundary, is refused, and becomes a failed trajectory.
## Deliberately incomplete

No platform capability from Chapters 29–37 exists yet. Chapter 27 introduces the next manuscript pressure.

## Architecture evolution at this checkpoint

The tracked responsibility map now contains only the packages earned through Chapter 26. Later packages are absent from this branch.
